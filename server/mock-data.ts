        'Enlarge / When Google, whose Chromium/Chrome-related browsers make up 80% of browser share, says that something has "not enough interest from the entire ecosystem," what does that mean, exactly? Aurich Lawson reader comments 73 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Chrome developers\' decision to remove support for a compressed image format that Google helped develop is just another sign of "the disturbing amount of control" the ad company has over browsers and the web, according to the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In a statement , Greg Farough, campaigns manager at the FSF, took aim at Google\'s stated reason for deprecating support for the JPEG XL image format , which was based on Google\'s PIK format . A Google engineer, commenting on the JPEG XL issue tracker on Chromium, Chrome\'s open source core project, wrote that "there is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL." The format also "does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats," and removing it "reduces the maintenance burden," the engineer wrote. "Putting aside the problematic aspects of the term \'ecosystem\' when you yourself are by far the largest and most dangerous predator in said \'ecosystem,\'" Farough wrote (adding his own link). "In supposedly gauging what the \'ecosystem\' wants, all Google is really doing is asking itself what Google wants." If you don\'t recognize JPEG XL, it\'s because it was pretty easy to miss. The format was frozen in late 2020 and was available as an experimental feature (i.e., flag setting) in Chrome version 91. It was removed in Chrome 110 (as I\'ve confirmed in Chrome 112). JPEG XL proponents suggested widespread adoption of the format could spur a 25–30 percent reduction in global bandwidth use (paywall). Even with their optimism, however, people like Jon Sneyers at Cloudinary told New Scientist in 2021 that adoption is "almost a political issue, in that companies may have their own file formats that are subject to royalties that they would like to see adopted as standards." Very few programs supported JPEG XL at the time. "Once we have support in at least a big chunk of the [Internet] browsers, the companies like Facebook will probably start deploying quite quickly and others will follow," Sneyers told New Scientist. Advertisement Sneyers\' less optimistic predictions came true, though not with regard to royalties. Apple, Google, and Mozilla got behind AV1F instead. AV1F display support is already baked into Android 12 , macOS 13 , iOS 16, and a bunch of browsers (though not Microsoft\'s Edge, curiously). While AV1F is licensed royalty-free, exactly how the technology is licensed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), which includes many of the world\'s largest technology firms, is under investigation by European Union antitrust regulators . "The [European] Commission has information that AOM and its members may be imposing licensing terms (mandatory royalty-free cross licensing) on innovators that were not a part of AOM at the time of the creation of the AV1 technical, but whose patents are deemed essential to (its) technical specifications," a questionnaire sent to tech companies read, according to Reuters. Further complicating JPEG-XL\'s chances, Microsoft received a patent on a core compression algorithm used in JPEG XL along with numerous other compression schemes. Experts in the digital image space disagreed on whether it presented a problem for JPEG XL. Ars contributor Timothy Lee told The Register that Microsoft\'s patent, which came three years after a Google application for a similar Asymmetric Numeral System (ANS) patent, illustrated broader problems with the software patent system. For its part, Mozilla, both a supporter of AV1F and the browser company the FSF specifically points to as being able to hold back a Chrome hegemony, declared itself "neutral" in a standards position post on GitHub in late January . Mozilla\'s Martin Thomson wrote that while JPEG XL "offers some potential advantages," it wasn\'t "performing enough better than its closest competitors (like AV1F) to justify addition on that basis alone." Mozilla might support JPEG XL "if usage becomes more widespread, but that will be a product decision." One thing that certainly could have made JPEG XL usage more widespread would have been Chrome\'s full adoption of the format. Chrome accounts for nearly two-thirds of worldwide browser usage , according to StatCounter, and roughly 80 percent if you include browsers based on Chromium (Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave, among others). JPEGs have stuck around, albeit optimized, for 30 years, in large part due to their ubiquity across software, devices, and the wider web. Chrome recently moved the WebGPU API from a flagged option to default support , promising huge potential for highly portable graphics. Google, having decided to drop JPEG XL in Chrome, open-sourced an " attention center model " machine learning tool used in the format in December 2022. It works by guessing which area of an image will catch people\'s eyes first to prioritize that area\'s resolution before the rest of the image is loaded.',

      content:
        'Enlarge / Apple\'s Mac Studio desktop. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 20 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit We\'re generally fans of Apple\'s now-year-old Mac Studio desktop—and skeptical about its now-year-late Apple Silicon Mac Pro refresh. The Studio addresses many of the needs of the Mac Pro\'s intended audience in a smaller device that costs less money, while the Apple Silicon Mac Pro seems likely to dispense with at least some of the upgradeability and versatility of past generations. Further Reading After a sharp sales slump, report details some of Apple’s future Mac lineup Reports have suggested that Apple could skip an M2-powered Mac Studio refresh to make that planned Mac Pro more appealing to potential buyers when it arrives. But that doesn\'t mean the Mac Studio is going away; Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman says that a pair of Mac Studio updates are being "planned," though he doesn\'t know when they\'ll be out. (We would assume that the difference between the two models comes down to which processor they use; the M1 Mac and M1 Ultra versions of the Studio have several differences aside from raw CPU and GPU speed.) That nugget is one of several in a summary of Apple\'s plans for its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Gurman adds small details to several stories he has reported in the recent past; the most interesting for Mac users is the 15-inch MacBook Air, which he said late last week would likely include an M2 processor and the same 3024×1964 screen resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Gurman now says Apple plans to announce the new Air at WWDC. Advertisement Macs with newer M3 processors, including updated versions of the 13-inch MacBook Air and Pro, could come "this year or in 2024." Gurman believes any laptops announced during WWDC will continue to use M2 processors, and the other MacBook models mentioned already include the M2. Apple\'s biggest announcement at WWDC is still expected to be a new VR and AR headset , along with an operating system referred to internally as "xrOS." The headset project has reportedly been divisive inside Apple, going back to its inception in 2015 . A New York Times report from March highlighted continuing internal "skepticism" about the product, from its features to its design to its release timing to its price (supposedly "roughly $3,000"). There will still be plenty of software announcements at WWDC, but Gurman expects most of them to be low-key. He says this year\'s iOS, iPadOS, and macOS updates will be relatively minor, though iOS and iPadOS could be modified to allow app sideloading to comply with new European Union regulations . The exception is watchOS, which Gurman says is getting its "biggest update... since the first version was introduced in 2015." The evolution of watchOS and the Apple Watch has been gradual; originally pitched as a sort of do-everything extension of your phone, its focus slowly shifted away from general-purpose apps to health and fitness. While Gurman isn\'t specific about what this update entails, it will reportedly feature "an updated interface."',

        'Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 151 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Every month, you pay a bill for cell phone service. Somehow, that access needs to make it to your device. The SIM card, or "subscriber identity module," connects your phone with your phone bill. While you might expect authentication to happen over a network with a simple username and password, cell phones predate the Internet, so SIM cards can seem a little old-fashioned. Still, the industry is trying to modernize itself while maintaining backward compatibility with older devices, and that has led to the rise of many different SIM card formats. The newest is iSIM, the latest advancement in a never-ending quest to save space in your smartphone. Ye olde physical SIM card Enlarge / Common physical SIM card sizes. Wikipedia Physical SIM cards have been around forever. They\'re the hunks of plastic you get from your phone carrier and slide into your cell phone. A small gold chip printed on the card—much like those on credit cards—makes electrical contact with the slot in your phone. Even these physical cards have their own standards and have shrunk over time; there\'s Mini SIM, Micro SIM, and Nano SIM, which all use the same chip with differing amounts of plastic around it. Advertisement Going back even further, there was a credit card-sized "Standard SIM" without any of the diminutive prefixes. If you want to understand why SIM cards work the way they do, it\'s worth looking at how these smart cards previously operated. Many of the earliest cell phones in the 1980s were fixed car phones or 12-pound luggable devices with shoulder straps and lead acid batteries. (The first cell phone, the Motorola DynaTac , was a lot smaller, but it had a half-hour battery life. Practical phones needed to be much bigger.) Enlarge / A pre-SIM "smart card" for the Motorola PRX C451 from the incredible "BrickCellphones" YouTube channel. See that white arrow and slot on the phone body? That\'s where the card goes. BrickCellphones Since phones were less portable at that time, you could take your "smart card" with you instead (they didn\'t use the "SIM" standard yet). The card contained your billing information and address book so you could just slot it into any phone and make a call. It used a credit card form factor because you used it a lot like a credit card—you might be expected to insert it into multiple phones each day to pay for phone service. (If you\'ve ever noticed how a SIM card chip and a chipped credit card look the same, they are based on the same standard, ISO/IEC 7816 .) The card slots in early phones were also very easy to access, making frequent card swaps as easy as using a credit card terminal. You could rent a car, stick your credit-card-sized SIM into the car phone, and off you went.',

        'So much for rumors that a larger MacBook Air could pack an upgraded chip.',
      content:
        "Apple's long-rumored 15-inch MacBook Air is likely to be released this June at WWDC 2023 , where we expect to learn more about iOS 17 , the launch of Apple's AR/VR headset , and other updates. The laptop will feature a processor \"on par\" with the company's current M2 chip, according to internal App Store developer logs reviewed by Bloomberg . The 15-inch MacBook Air could soon join its slightly smaller sibling, the 13.6-inch Apple MacBook Air M2 , among the best laptops on the market. Apple's purportedly been testing the laptop's compatibility with third-party apps, something it often does ahead of a new device's release. The chip in the new MacBook Air model spotted in the logs packed identical specs to the M2 chip: eight processing cores, ten graphics cores and 8GB of RAM. That's disappointing given other rumors that the 15-inch MacBook Air would offer beefed-up specs alongside a larger screen. Instead, the laptop would share the same chip as the Apple MacBook Air M2. Sure, it's a significant boost in speed compared to the more affordable Apple MacBook Air M1 . But rumors of a yet-unreleased Apple M3 chip have fueled speculation that Apple's larger version of the MacBook Air would come with an upgraded chip to match. That doesn't appear to be the case. However, a new MacBook sporting the M3 chip is still in the cards for early next year. Bloomberg suggests that “higher-end versions of the M3 chip” are expected to follow for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro “in the first half of 2024.\" While would-be 15-inch MacBook Air buyers may be disappointed, there is some good news in the report. Firstly, the logs listed the tested laptop as running macOS 14, which is expected to be announced at WWDC alongside iOS 17. That strongly suggests that the new MacBook will ship with the new and shiny operating system when it releases. The logs also listed a display resolution of 3024 x 1964, indicating Apple won’t just be stretching the current Air’s 2560 x 1664 display onto the new, larger screen. The 15-inch version would boast the same resolution Apple uses on its 14-inch MacBook Pro , though inevitably it's likely to lose a little sharpness on a larger, 15.3-inch display. Of course, all of this information should be taken with a grain of salt without Apple's confirmation. But with just a few weeks until WWDC, we can be confident everything will become clear soon.",

        "The next generation of Motorola Razr flip phones could double its offerings and challenge Samsung's top spot for best foldable phones . New prototype design renders from MySmartPrice (opens in new tab) suggest the fourth-generation of Motorola's clamshell smartphones will launch with two headsets, the standard Motorola Razr 2023 rebranded and redesigned as the \"Razr Lite\" and a premium option called the \"Razr Plus.\" A collaboration between MySmartPrice and OnLeaks (opens in new tab) recently revealed unofficial design renders of a device referred to as the Motorola “Razr Lite.” The renders show off a dual-lens rear camera setup next to the cover display, an LED flash module below the camera sensors, slim bezels around the sides of the screen and a smaller outside display compared to previous models. So... Today, I can reveal #Motorola isn't going to launch 1 but 2 #Razr phones this year!And here comes ur very 1st look at this flip phone which I assume will be unveiled as vanilla #Razr2023 or more likely #MotorolaRazrLite!On behalf @mysmartprice 👉🏻 https://t.co/MQO4C7poL6 pic.twitter.com/Gvuf7hGPYc April 15, 2023 The outside display stretches across the full width of the device, but only takes up about a fourth of the phone's total area when folded. That's much smaller than that of the Motorola Razr 2022 . Motorola could be taking a page from Samsung's book there, as the Razr Lite's design is more in line with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 as far as workable space is concerned. How else this “Lite” version could differ from previous generations of the rumored Razr Plus remains unclear. But given the design, it does seem like this model's aimed at undercutting the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 . Most interestingly, these renders indicate that the major upgrades already rumored for Motorola's latest generation of foldable phones — a larger cover display, two-tone color designs, and improved tech under the hood — would be exclusive to the Plus model. There's no word on pricing yet, but Motorola is likely to use these upgrades to justify a higher price point for the Razr Plus model compared to the Razr Lite. Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt. MySmartPrice notes that the official marketing name has not been confirmed, so the Razr Lite name may not even stick and Motorola will simply call it the Razr 2023. \"It is worth noting that the design renders are based on low-quality, real-life pictures of a testing stage prototype,\" MySmartPrice also writes. \"Therefore, it is likely that some details depicted in these renders may differ a bit compared to the final product.\" Motorola is expected to launch its fourth generation of foldable smartphones in August, so we'll likely learn more as that date gets closer.",

        'New case leaks show both Google Pixel 8 models could maintain the distinctive thick camera bar for a third generation.',
      content:
        "Design-wise, there wasn’t a great deal of difference between Google's Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 smartphones. Now new case renders for the upcoming Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro from MySmartPrice (opens in new tab) suggest that this is going to be the case for the third generation running. Both clear case designs show a large area molded to fit the handset’s distinctive camera bar, with the key differences being how wide the lens cutouts are on each. The Pixel 8 case shows a pill-shaped hole on the back that looks like it’ll be enough for two lenses to peek through. With the Pixel 7, that was a 50MP, f/1.85 main lens, backed up by a 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide sensor. Whether the specs change in any way, it doesn’t look like Google is planning to add a third camera to the mix. While MySmartPrice doesn’t share dimensions, we’ve heard that the regular Pixel 8 will actually be a little smaller than its predecessor . It’s rumored to be dropping from having a 6.32-inch display on the Pixel 7 to a 6.16-inch panel on the Pixel 8. Not a huge difference, but noticeable — and certainly enough to ensure that existing Pixel 7 cases won’t even come close to fitting. The Pixel 8 Pro case, meanwhile, has a wider pill-shaped cutout to comfortably accommodate a third lens. While the Pixel 7 Pro had its third 48MP, f/3.5, 5x telephoto lens sitting away from the other two in a circular cutout, early renders suggest it will be included in a wider pill array this time around. The other interesting thing to note from this case is the cutout to the right of the pill. It’s larger than you would need for just a flash, which was in that position on the Pixel 7 Pro, suggesting that rumors of an additional mystery sensor are also on the mark. Whether this will be for macro, depth or something else entirely is still up in the air. It’s unsurprising that Google would want to keep the same camera bar, which has become a calling card for Pixel phones. Though not for everyone, it’s certainly distinctive — and in a world of look-alike black rectangles, the familiar visor genuinely makes recent Pixels stand out. The real test will be how the Pixel 8 performs, of course, and last month we got an early look at the chip that might power the phone . If this is indeed the Tensor G3, it will pack a Cortex-X3 at 3.09GHz, four Cortex-A715 cores at 2.65GHz, four more Cortex-A1510s at 2.1GHz and an Xclipse 930 GPU at 1.4GHz. Those specs would likely put it a little behind its Qualcomm Snapdragon and Apple A-series rivals as with previous generations , but it could still be a solid step forwards for the series as a whole. While the Pixel 8 series isn’t expected until the fall, we may get an early look at it as early as next month. Google I/O 2023 starts on May 10, and the developer conference has previously seen early glimpses of upcoming hardware — including the Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch last year.",

        'An iPhone 14 Pro currently costs $999, which makes it a pricey device, but there have been rumors that the iPhone 15 Pro could set you back even more. Around $100 more, according to analysts, which would mean you could end up paying at least $1,099 for an iPhone 15 Pro and $1,199 for an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Needless to say, price increases are never a good thing, especially when you’re talking about products that are already rather expensive. Word is that the iPhone 15 Pro range will come with a great many upgrades, like the A17 Bionic chipset, solid-state buttons (maybe), a periscope camera, and potentially even a titanium chassis. Unfortunately, it seems those upgrades will come with a very real price, with analysts blaming the improvements for this rumored price hike. But as much as Apple might try to justify increasing prices in this way, it’s still a bad idea. Here’s why.',

        'Enlarge / Apple\'s Mac Studio desktop. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 20 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit We\'re generally fans of Apple\'s now-year-old Mac Studio desktop—and skeptical about its now-year-late Apple Silicon Mac Pro refresh. The Studio addresses many of the needs of the Mac Pro\'s intended audience in a smaller device that costs less money, while the Apple Silicon Mac Pro seems likely to dispense with at least some of the upgradeability and versatility of past generations. Further Reading After a sharp sales slump, report details some of Apple’s future Mac lineup Reports have suggested that Apple could skip an M2-powered Mac Studio refresh to make that planned Mac Pro more appealing to potential buyers when it arrives. But that doesn\'t mean the Mac Studio is going away; Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman says that a pair of Mac Studio updates are being "planned," though he doesn\'t know when they\'ll be out. (We would assume that the difference between the two models comes down to which processor they use; the M1 Mac and M1 Ultra versions of the Studio have several differences aside from raw CPU and GPU speed.) That nugget is one of several in a summary of Apple\'s plans for its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Gurman adds small details to several stories he has reported in the recent past; the most interesting for Mac users is the 15-inch MacBook Air, which he said late last week would likely include an M2 processor and the same 3024×1964 screen resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Gurman now says Apple plans to announce the new Air at WWDC. Advertisement Macs with newer M3 processors, including updated versions of the 13-inch MacBook Air and Pro, could come "this year or in 2024." Gurman believes any laptops announced during WWDC will continue to use M2 processors, and the other MacBook models mentioned already include the M2. Apple\'s biggest announcement at WWDC is still expected to be a new VR and AR headset , along with an operating system referred to internally as "xrOS." The headset project has reportedly been divisive inside Apple, going back to its inception in 2015 . A New York Times report from March highlighted continuing internal "skepticism" about the product, from its features to its design to its release timing to its price (supposedly "roughly $3,000"). There will still be plenty of software announcements at WWDC, but Gurman expects most of them to be low-key. He says this year\'s iOS, iPadOS, and macOS updates will be relatively minor, though iOS and iPadOS could be modified to allow app sideloading to comply with new European Union regulations . The exception is watchOS, which Gurman says is getting its "biggest update... since the first version was introduced in 2015." The evolution of watchOS and the Apple Watch has been gradual; originally pitched as a sort of do-everything extension of your phone, its focus slowly shifted away from general-purpose apps to health and fitness. While Gurman isn\'t specific about what this update entails, it will reportedly feature "an updated interface."',
