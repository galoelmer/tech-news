        'SpaceX is already testing tech that could strengthen the ground beneath its giant Starship rockets orbital launch pad, a new video shows. That pad, at SpaceXs Starbase facility in South Texas, took a beating during the first-ever test flight of a fully stacked Starship vehicle — the most powerful rocket ever built — on April 20. The immense power of Starships 33 first-stage Raptor engines blasted out a crater beneath the pad that day, sending chunks of broken concrete flying through the dusty air.',

        'Stoke Space has received multiple investments from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, TechCrunch has learned. Stoke Space and In-Q-Tel have not publicly announced their relationship before. While In-Q-Tel is legally a separate entity from any government agency, it receives all of its funding from government partners, including the defense and intelligence community. In-Q-Tel Principal William Morrison confirmed he led the most recent investment, which closed at the end of February, and that the firm has made multiple investments in the company before. In addition to the investment, the two entities also signed a “technology development agreement,” an In-Q-Tel spokesperson said. Stoke joins a very small cadre of launch companies — including Rocket Lab and ABL Space Systems — that have received investment from the firm. “The team has been incredible at execution, insanely capital efficient,” Morrison said. Kent, Washington-based Stoke was founded in 2019 by Andy Lapsa and Tom Feldman. They started the company after years-long stints as propulsion engineers at Blue Origin; when they left, Lapsa held a director-level position and Feldman was a senior engineer. Stoke is developing a fully reusable launch vehicle capable of returning both the booster and the second stage back to Earth. The rocket is being designed to fly daily, a feature that is likely especially attractive to defense customers. The U.S. Space Force has publicly stated its interest in procuring rapid turn-around launch capabilities. Stoke raised $65 million in a Series A round in December 2021, from investors including Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Toyota Ventures and Spark Capital. More recently, the USSF said it would set aside a dedicated area for Stoke’s use at the historic Cape Canaveral — Launch Complex 14, where multiple lift-offs occurred in the 1960s. According to its website, Stoke is currently preparing to fly the reusable upper stage on a vertical take-off and landing “hopper” test flight. “Space access continues to be launch availability constrained,” Lapsa said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Building a robust commercial launch economy is critical to sustaining our industrial base and ensuring space access for defense and national security needs.” In-Q-Tel was established in 1999 as a not-for-profit venture to help the federal government take advantage of growing innovation and emerging technologies in the private sector. The firm sources technology from startups for the CIA and other government agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security. One of In-Q-Tel’s key value propositions is facilitating connections between private companies and its government partners, including in the intelligence community. In-Q-Tel has made 25 investments in the space sector, including Stoke. Other investments include Capella Space, Palantir and Swarm Technologies, which was acquired by SpaceX. Checks usually range from $250,000 to $3 million, the firm says on its website. An In-Q-Tel spokesperson confirmed all of its investments in Stoke are within that window. Morrison added in a separate written statement that access to space is an important focus area for the firm. “Stoke Space’s unique architecture has the potential to change the way we all design for and use space,” he said.',

        'Newchip , an online accelerator promising to help startups, has filed for bankruptcy and is now facing insolvency amid employee and client discontent. Dozens of employees of the troubled organization staged a walkout on May 4, demanding that founder Andrew Ryan step down as CEO. Ryan — who previously went by the name of Ryan Rafols — started Austin-based Newchip in 2016 after spending more than seven years as a city commissioner in Austin, according to his LinkedIn profile . Newchip initially started out, according to Grit Daily , “ as an aggregator of top deals from various equity-based crowdfunding platforms,” and later evolved into its current accelerator model. In his LinkedIn profile, Ryan describes Newchip as an entity that provides “ entrepreneurs with all of the skills and tools necessary to build, scale, and fund their startups from launch to exit” via its “online global accelerator and venture fund.” Essentially, Newchip presented itself as an accelerator that would help startups meet and raise money from investors and grow their companies for a fee. But the accelerator failed to deliver on a number of its promises, some employees say, and left hanging founders who had signed up. Some founders argued, in interviews with TechCrunch and in at least one public post discussion on LinkedIn , that Newchip’s fee — which varied from a few thousand dollars to up to $18,000 or $20,000 — was too high and not worth the services provided. Some insisted that it was difficult to impossible to get a refund when the accelerator did not follow through. Chief among the long list of complaints by eight former employees who walked out and were interviewed by TechCrunch is “mismanagement” on Ryan’s part. The executive, they claimed, regularly was aggressive toward individuals in the company via written and verbal communications, and made poor decisions regarding leadership roles. One former employee who wished to remain anonymous told TechCrunch: “He would routinely often hire either naïve or ‘yes man’ type employees and get absolutely ruthless and degrading and demeaning to people while saying things like ‘I’m too good to be wasting my brilliance on this’ and just scream at people.” In response as to whether he was demeaning to employees, Ryan acknowledged that his leadership style was based on “a military mindset” and that “there have been moments where the line between accountability and conflict has blurred.” He also admitted that in one particular instance, he could see how his reaction “might have come across as demeaning.” Ryan also added that he’s been “known to walk out of or abruptly end meetings lacking an agenda, emphasizing the importance of preparation.” In a Zoom interview with TechCrunch and in two different LinkedIn posts (which can be found here and here ), Ryan largely blamed the macro environment, managers and employees for the company’s demise. Via email, Ryan said he ultimately accepted “full responsibility for the events at Newchip.” He claimed to currently be “in discussions with numerous VC firms, family offices, and PE firms to formulate a continuity plan.” Newchip, operating under Astralabs, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, revealing that it had just $1.7 million in assets compared to $4.8 million in liabilities. Last week, a bankruptcy judge ended up converting the case to Chapter 7 liquidation. This is unsurprising, considering that, according to Grit Daily : “ While Newchip raised $7.9 million from accredited and nonaccredited investors, Crunchbase data reveals a troubling history of financial losses. SEC filings show a net loss of $197,884 for 2016, a $748,999 loss in 2017, and the company claimed $4.5 million in tax loss carryforwards in its 2020 financial statements.” Ryan claimed the employees staged the recent walkout to protest the fact that the company was going to be laying off more employees, and were led by a Newchip investor. While Ryan did not name the investor, that individual is believed to be Joe Merrill, who also served as chief of Newchip’s board. (TechCrunch reached out to Merrill but he did not respond to requests for comment.) Ryan added that the accelerator had already conducted several rounds of layoffs over the previous six months, going from more than 200 employees to about 75 at the beginning of this month. Speaking to TechCrunch, Ryan said: “We had to make cuts across the team and there was gonna be massive layoffs […] Otherwise there would be no money to pay people and we had to cut the business down. And while I requested approval from the court to take on capital and we had investors ready to give us capital, our attorneys had failed to file the motion. And so we basically pushed them to file for [an] emergency filing.” He claimed that employees were not happy with that move and demanded that he “wind the company down and basically liquidate everything,” which he said he could not do while in Chapter 11 proceedings. Ryan said he went on to terminate the board. For their part, the eight former employees TechCrunch spoke with deny walking out due to potentially being laid off or not getting paid and instead cite Ryan’s “lack of leadership and mismanagement.” In their walkout letter (which was shared with TechCrunch), the employees wrote of their concerns over the dismissals of “key personnel,” saying their “removal has led to an erosion of trust and morale within the organization, creating a toxic work environment.” The employees demanded the execs be reinstated and that Ryan step down as CEO “effective immediately.” No one was reinstated. Via email, Ryan told TechCrunch: “In the end, we were unfortunately compelled to close the company despite having secured capital commitments to keep it moving forward due to the takeover attempt and false allegations made to the court that we could be liquidated for half a billion dollars if the court just signed off, which understandably led to frustration right now and a lot of our 1,200 active companies are rightfully upset. I empathize deeply with everyone affected and am taking every possible measure to rectify the situation.” He also said the company would “be bringing in a new, more experienced CEO.” It isn’t just employees who say they were burned by Newchip. Andrew Goei, founder of PitchPages, a pitch deck and fundraising software startup, said he wanted a refund a few months into the program after he felt he was not getting the promised services, specifically the investor intros. In an interview with TechCrunch, Goei recalled Newchip’s salespeople telling him the accelerator “has this huge network and can introduce us to all these investors.” PitchPages would pay $8,000, and if the company didn’t get successful funding, the company would get its money back, Goei said. So his company signed up in August of that year. “About two or three weeks into it, we still had no communication from them at all, even though we paid,” Goei said. At that point, PitchPages had paid about $6,000 to the program. During that time, Goei said he met two mentors from the program who voiced concerns about Newchip and recommended Goei get a refund. Weeks would go by before customer support people would respond, and ultimately he was told there would be no refund, Goei told us. “It was very apparent that their whole model was ‘get as many startups as we can. We don’t care who they are. We don’t care what stage they’re in as long as they pay, that’s all that matters,’” Goei said. “And they would find any way possible and not give any refunds. What was really sad about the whole thing is that Newchip was started by this guy who comes from the VC community.” Founder Orri Bogdan, too, told TechCrunch that Newchip’s salespeople told him that they would offer a full refund if he failed to raise funding through the outfit, but then “snuck in extreme stipulations with the intention of never refunding anyone.” The founder of VAE Labs, which is developing an edible energy spray , Bogdan says that as a result of Newchip’s terms, his startup declined its offer to “accept” his company in favor of joining a different accelerator. “If we hadn’t gotten into DSHA, we would have definitely accepted and lost $7,500 to $18,000, with the higher price depending on if we accepted their $250,000 warrant or not,” Bogdan said. Former Newchip employees told TechCrunch that the company “rarely issued refunds.” They also claimed that the company paid customers to remove negative reviews. Ryan disputes both of those claims. He said it was stated in the customer contract that refunds were not given, for example, when companies folded. He also said that it was “a very common practice” for customers to use negative reviews to try and get a refund. “They don’t qualify for refunds, so they leave a review and they email you back and say ‘Hey, give me my refund and I’ll take this down,’” Ryan said. “We gave about $150,000 in refunds a month. For a business that brings in about a million dollars in tax, that’s a significant amount — that’s about three times the amount that you’d see in any case.” Ryan also said he “tried to train some of the low-level marketing people” to keep up with positive review management, but that they “would often fail to do that.” Via email, Ryan also claimed that Newchip “ lost money on nearly each and every admission” to its programs “due to the high risk and failure of startups.” Though the employee group has more recently gone public with their grievances, they make claims of mismanagement going back years, including the clawback of sales commissions and Ryan giving himself bonuses during monthly financial deficits. For example, the group said sales commissions were awarded when a contract was instituted, but allege that later they were removed for what they were told were unsigned contracts, even though the customer was actively paying. Ryan disputes that allegation, telling TechCrunch that 200 to 300 contracts weren’t signed, amounting to around $1 million, and that he found out some team members were “lying to clients” and charging accounts anyway. “ We strictly adhered to the principle of paying admissions commissions only after contracts were signed to our knowledge. Unfortunately, in Q4 of the previous year, we discovered instances of non-compliance within our admissions team concentrated in a handful of individuals making up about 10% of our team,” Ryan said via email. At that time, the employee group says Ryan made himself head of sales. When asked if that was accurate, Ryan confirmed, though he said it was temporary while the company sought a replacement. Ryan also told TechCrunch via email that his first year “to receive pay over $75k since 2016” was in 2020, when he received $92,000, and in 2021 it was $175,000 and in 2022, $287,000, “equating to approximately 1.4% of revenue.” He added that “about a third of amounts yearly were performance-based bonuses.” At the time of writing, it remained unclear as to what would happen to the entrepreneurs participating in the program, the remainder of employees and the company itself. The group of former employees said they are reaching out to other accelerators and to the startup ecosystem to see if they can assist the founders affected by the liquidation. Ryan said he was “in search of a white knight” to support the company and take over its programs.',

        'Enlarge (credit: Getty Images | Christopher Furlong ) Elon Musk\'s lawyer, Alex Spiro, yesterday sent a letter to Microsoft accusing the company of using the Twitter APIs in ways that violated Twitter policies. Spiro\'s letter came about a month after Microsoft halted API use instead of paying new fees and Musk threatened to sue Microsoft, claiming it was "illegally using Twitter data." "As you are no doubt aware, for years, Microsoft has used Twitter\'s standard developer APIs free of charge in order to benefit from Twitter\'s data and services in key Microsoft products that generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for Microsoft annually," Spiro wrote to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. "Up until last month, when it declined to pay even a discounted rate for continued access to Twitter\'s APIs and content, Microsoft operated eight separate Twitter API apps, listed below, which appear to provide data and functionality for at least five separate Microsoft products and services, including Xbox One, Bing Pages, Azure, Power Platform, and Ads." Twitter—which is facing numerous lawsuits alleging it hasn\'t paid its bills—is asking Microsoft to complete a compliance audit on its API usage by June 7.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments',

      content:
        'Enlarge (credit: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / Contributor | AFP) Surprising no one, immediately after Montana became the first state to ban TikTok on Wednesday, five TikTokers in the state with thousands of followers banded together and sued to block the ban. The TikTokers argued that the ban is a huge overstep by the state because it\'s "unconstitutional and preempted by federal law." According to their complaint, Montana’s claimed interests in enacting the ban to shield minors and prevent foreign spying "are not legitimate and do not support a blanket ban on TikTok. Montana has no authority to enact laws advancing what it believes should be the United States’ foreign policy or its national security interests, nor may Montana ban an entire forum for communication based on its perceptions that some speech shared through that forum, though protected by the First Amendment, is dangerous." Citing First Amendment concerns, the TikTokers argued that the ban is "substantially overbroad" and "suppresses far more speech than it may permissibly regulate." They say that restricting access to content for all users just to address concerns that minors may access some TikTok content that\'s "dangerous" goes too far. The First Amendment requires the government to find the "least restrictive means" of regulating speech when the government does have a "compelling" interest. Quite the opposite, Montana\'s ban, they argued, is an example of the government finding "the most restrictive means imaginable."Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments',

        'Back at CES in Las Vegas in January this year, I previewed the Nuwa Pen; a three-camera-containing ballpoint pen that promises to turn your scribbles into digital notes and then apply OCR and AI smarts to pull out the most pertinent data. Write “Meeting with Chris at 6pm Tuesday” on a Post-it and the promise is that the pen will pull out the relevant data and create a calendar event. In late April, I met up with the company’s founder and had a chance to try it out. When I did, I realized that the product I saw at CES did not produce the results the company was showing at the trade show. This week, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign that shows its vision, but doesn’t appear to reflect the current status of the product fully. At CES, I was told that the company had a fully functioning prototype, and was shown a Post-it with a digitized image: The “demo” the company showed me at CES was similar to this image, and illustrated how easily the drawing on the Post-it can be digitized. It now transpires that the demo wasn’t done with the pens that were on display. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps When I got to try the pen out four months later, it turned out that the demo I was shown wasn’t quite what it seemed to be. On April 27, the company’s product was able to capture very simple glyphs accurately, but only a single stroke at the time, and drawing a little house on a Post-it note would be comprehensively beyond the pen’s reach. A curl as written on the left, and as captured on the right. It showed up mirrored in the app, but at least had roughly the right shape. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps The issue, for me, is that the Kickstarter project doesn’t reflect Nuwa Pen’s current product status In April, Marc Tuinier, Nuwa’s founder and CEO, admitted that the prototype the company brought to CES was “a rush job,” and that the company only had it working partially. He suggested that the hardware was locked at this point, and that the next two to three months would be largely around optimizing the algorithms. Nuwa told me that it has the prototype working properly in “chunky boxes,” but that the final integration step of putting the tech into the form factor of the pen shown in the pictures isn’t complete yet. “The model we used to draw and digitize the pages for the video is the bulkier version that had the chip on a dev board so that we had more control over tweaking the software,” Tuinier confirmed in an email to TechCrunch today. That makes a lot of sense; that is how product development works: You create the design and the tech separately and marry them together later in the development process. I got into some of how that process worked in an article last month. 7 common pitfalls for hardware startups and how to avoid them Misleading at best The issue, for me, is that the Kickstarter project doesn’t reflect Nuwa Pen’s current product status — in particular in the crowdfunding project’s video. In the video “Nuwa Pen : The Journey so Far….How we got here?” at about 1 minute and 10 seconds in, you can hear Tuinier say “So once you’re done writing, you can hold the Nuwa Pen up close to your app, and you can see an exact digital representation of what you just wrote.” The problem is, as far as I understand, the company is not currently able to do that with that prototype. Even in the video the company provided to TechCrunch, “exact representation” may be a bit of a stretch. Instead, this was the status quo in April: I wrote “write” and “test” and drew a shape. At the top, you can see what the pen and app captured. As you can also see — there’s virtually no similarity between my awful handwriting and what the Nuwa Pen captured. Image Credits: TechCrunch / Haje Kamps I’m finding it hard to reconcile that a video called “the journey so far” contains a lot of “we will be able to” statements rather than an accurate representation of, well, the journey so far. On the one hand, as a pitch coach and storyteller, I understand the importance of storytelling. And as someone who was spectacularly bitten by a crowdfunding hardware project I tried (and failed) to deliver myself, I also believe in the importance of being honest about the delta between what is real and what’s part of the product vision. This is challenging for a number of reasons. This sort of thing is, incidentally, also the reason why I very rarely cover Kickstarter campaigns here on TechCrunch. On a basic level, Kickstarter itself says that “hardware and product design creators are required to show working prototypes of their projects” and requires that product creators “show backers the development of your product, both honestly and transparently.” I am definitely not the arbiter of whether Nuwa Pen is falling foul of Kickstarter’s rules here, but I believe it’d be hard to argue that this Kickstarter campaign is good-faith honesty and transparency. Nuwa Pen argues it can deliver I asked the company whether it was worried that what it was trying to do might prove to be impossible. “We’re using a consistent hardware tech stack and fine-tuning the embedded software to flash it (integrate it) on the compact version I showed you. Internally we have a development version with the cameras being operational – they are crucial but take significant effort to perfect. So while the version I showed you is smaller, the internals are consistent,” Tuinier explained in an emailed comment today, after the Kickstarter campaign went live, and I asked him whether he perceived the risks were significant. The Kickstarter campaign’s backers noticed that none of the materials provided by Nuwa on the campaign page shows the product actually in use. Image Credits: Kickstarter / Nuwa Pen “The difference is that we have more control and flexibility with the larger version, particularly regarding camera development. As for financial risks, we did face some uncertainties early in the project, but our showing at CES helped to mitigate those. We’re now adding to our funding through Kickstarter to extend Nuwa Pen’s future. In this same line of thought, we also needed to update our delivery timeline, which was more in line with our development. We now aim to ship the first batch in December and the Kickstarter batch in March, which is later than initially expected since the miniaturization was a challenge we’ve managed to overcome,” Tuinier said in the statement. “We have completed most of the complex tasks and developed a functional pipeline in controlled environments. The development has been accelerating, which helps us to predict our timeline with much more accuracy. So yes, the product will function as well, as shown in the video. The key challenge we’re working on is the time needed to get the embedded software more compact.” The team provided a photo of the version of the pen that was used to create the results shown in the Kickstarter video, and asked that I not share it more widely, citing that “it exposes our MCU [Microcontroller], which isn’t public information.” The photo shows a pen with a ribbon cable running to a box the size of a deck of cards, which is then connected to a laptop with a USB cable. I also asked the Nuwa Pen team to record a video that shows the current version of its pen. A couple of days later, the team provided the below video, which appears to show a prototype of the pen running wirelessly and connecting to the app. It briefly shows the handwriting as captured, and shows that the company has made significant progress since I tried the device myself in April. It appears that the pen is now able to handle multiple pen strokes, and that the capture is robust enough to recognize the pen strokes as the word “hello.” It is still a ways away from being as accurate as is shown in the Kickstarter video. Backers need transparency And herein lies the crux; the Kickstarter videos are full of sleek, extremely well-produced videos, photos and product visions, with nary a developer kit in sight. Doubly frustrating; there’s a Risks and Challenges section at the bottom of the campaign that lists supply chains, “customs and shipping regulations” and “pandemics, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events” as risks, but fails to mention that the product doesn’t currently work as shown in the videos. Which, to me, seems like the biggest risk of all. Don’t get me wrong. I know product development can be very hard indeed, and that it’s a long road from idea, via prototype, to manufactured product. If and when the Nuwa Pen works the way the company envisions, I think it’ll be a cool product for those who still write with a pen on pieces of paper. As a startup, though, it’s a better idea to be transparent with Kickstarter backers — it turns out that a lot of the time, they don’t mind that a product is in development. The other alternative is to delay a crowdfunding campaign until a product actually works as shown. The in-between approach Nuwa Pen chose is misleading at best — and something far more nefarious at worst.

      content:
        'Enlarge / The regional headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California. (credit: Getty Images/Smith Collection) Like most people that try to switch to Bing, Samsung is giving up on the idea after a few weeks. An earlier report from The New York Times said Samsung was considering dumping Google Search on its Android phones in favor of the ChatGPT-powered Bing search engine. A month later, a new report from The Wall Street Journal says that while Samsung "isn’t permanently closing the door on Bing as a future option," it "won’t be swapping out the default search engine on its smartphones from Google to Microsoft’s Bing any time soon." The report on Samsung\'s possible switch to Bing came during negotiations between Samsung and Google to re-up their search engine contract, and the idea could have just been a negotiating tactic. These deals usually aren\'t public, but Google pays big cash piles to Apple and Samsung to make Google Search the default option on their devices. Microsoft\'s Bing was the butt of jokes for years, but its sudden integration of the red-hot ChatGPT generative AI has suddenly made it interesting. The earlier NYT report detailed Google\'s "shock" and "panic" when Samsung floated the idea of switching to Bing. There\'s a good chance that Samsung landed better contract terms. Whatever happened behind the scenes, the WSJ report says, "Samsung has decided it won’t further internally discuss the matter at this time given concerns over how the switch could be perceived by the market as well as the impact on its wide-ranging business relations with Google." Samsung does have a lot of contact issues to balance with Google. Samsung needs the Play Store and various Google Android apps to make a competitive phone, and that requires signing a contract for Google Play and being buddies with Google. Again, these contracts are secret, but in some regions, following Google\'s default app preferences means Google will pay companies to use Android. Going against the rules means they will be charged for Android.Read 1 remaining paragraphs | Comments',

Image Credits: Brian Heater I get it. I like free stuff, too. As a rule, however, if I do end up with some cheap promotional thing, I’ll give it away more often than not. I live in a one bedroom in New York, where the Collyer Brothers and Grey Gardens loom large. This, however, is my one exception at the moment. I currently have a small collection of robot stress balls (above). It’s a modest collection at three – Amazon, Hai and Locus – but there’s something about a tiny, colorful take on a big industrial robot that warms my heart. But as robot swag goes it’s hard to beat these two Lego kits I put together over lunch today. If there’s a better way to get someone to buy a very expense robot (Spot, for instance, is a cool $75,000), I haven’t seen it. Boston Dynamics has been using these to help promote Spot (46 pieces) and Stretch (44 pieces), but good luck getting a set if you’re not currently in the market for an industrial robot (I might be, but again, small apartment). For everyone else, there a couple of unofficial Boston Dynamics-inspired projects over on at the LEGO site to check out, including this 1:4 scale motorized version of Spot.

        'Enlarge (credit: Getty Images | Christopher Furlong ) Elon Musk\'s lawyer, Alex Spiro, yesterday sent a letter to Microsoft accusing the company of using the Twitter APIs in ways that violated Twitter policies. Spiro\'s letter came about a month after Microsoft halted API use instead of paying new fees and Musk threatened to sue Microsoft, claiming it was "illegally using Twitter data." "As you are no doubt aware, for years, Microsoft has used Twitter\'s standard developer APIs free of charge in order to benefit from Twitter\'s data and services in key Microsoft products that generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for Microsoft annually," Spiro wrote to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. "Up until last month, when it declined to pay even a discounted rate for continued access to Twitter\'s APIs and content, Microsoft operated eight separate Twitter API apps, listed below, which appear to provide data and functionality for at least five separate Microsoft products and services, including Xbox One, Bing Pages, Azure, Power Platform, and Ads." Twitter—which is facing numerous lawsuits alleging it hasn\'t paid its bills—is asking Microsoft to complete a compliance audit on its API usage by June 7.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments',

While none of the products in question are explicitly listed using Apple’s product names, they did come up when I searched for things like “AirPods” and “Apple Watch.” In many cases, there are multiple versions of these err, inspired items.

Needless to say, price increases are never a good thing, especially when you’re talking about products that are already rather expensive. Word is that the iPhone 15 Pro range will come with a great many upgrades, like the A17 Bionic chipset, solid-state buttons (maybe), a periscope camera, and potentially even a titanium chassis. Unfortunately, it seems those upgrades will come with a very real price, with analysts blaming the improvements for this rumored price hike.

      content:
        'Enlarge / Apple\'s Mac Studio desktop. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 20 with Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit We\'re generally fans of Apple\'s now-year-old Mac Studio desktop—and skeptical about its now-year-late Apple Silicon Mac Pro refresh. The Studio addresses many of the needs of the Mac Pro\'s intended audience in a smaller device that costs less money, while the Apple Silicon Mac Pro seems likely to dispense with at least some of the upgradeability and versatility of past generations. Further Reading After a sharp sales slump, report details some of Apple’s future Mac lineup Reports have suggested that Apple could skip an M2-powered Mac Studio refresh to make that planned Mac Pro more appealing to potential buyers when it arrives. But that doesn\'t mean the Mac Studio is going away; Bloomberg\'s Mark Gurman says that a pair of Mac Studio updates are being "planned," though he doesn\'t know when they\'ll be out. (We would assume that the difference between the two models comes down to which processor they use; the M1 Mac and M1 Ultra versions of the Studio have several differences aside from raw CPU and GPU speed.) That nugget is one of several in a summary of Apple\'s plans for its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Gurman adds small details to several stories he has reported in the recent past; the most interesting for Mac users is the 15-inch MacBook Air, which he said late last week would likely include an M2 processor and the same 3024×1964 screen resolution as the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Gurman now says Apple plans to announce the new Air at WWDC. Advertisement Macs with newer M3 processors, including updated versions of the 13-inch MacBook Air and Pro, could come "this year or in 2024." Gurman believes any laptops announced during WWDC will continue to use M2 processors, and the other MacBook models mentioned already include the M2. Apple\'s biggest announcement at WWDC is still expected to be a new VR and AR headset , along with an operating system referred to internally as "xrOS." The headset project has reportedly been divisive inside Apple, going back to its inception in 2015 . A New York Times report from March highlighted continuing internal "skepticism" about the product, from its features to its design to its release timing to its price (supposedly "roughly $3,000"). There will still be plenty of software announcements at WWDC, but Gurman expects most of them to be low-key. He says this year\'s iOS, iPadOS, and macOS updates will be relatively minor, though iOS and iPadOS could be modified to allow app sideloading to comply with new European Union regulations . The exception is watchOS, which Gurman says is getting its "biggest update... since the first version was introduced in 2015." The evolution of watchOS and the Apple Watch has been gradual; originally pitched as a sort of do-everything extension of your phone, its focus slowly shifted away from general-purpose apps to health and fitness. While Gurman isn\'t specific about what this update entails, it will reportedly feature "an updated interface."',
